# LoanCalculator
The loan calculator program can calculate both annuity and linear type loans.

Type in your desired loan amount, loan term, interest rate and choose the type of loan. 
Furthermore, you can add a loan deferment period where you will have to type the starting month, 
the length of deferment period (in months) and interest specifically for that period. 

After filling out all the fields and submitting the information you will be presented with 
--a table of monthly payments and a filter, 
--a graph that represents monthly payments of annuity and linear loans
--a button with an ability to save table contents to .xlsx file
